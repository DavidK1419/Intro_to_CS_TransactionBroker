# Intro_to_CS_TransactionBroker

This project is a simple brokerage bank account. The user starts out with 500 dollars in the account. After compiling, run the program as a one like string with commands with two numbers and an operator between them such as “add”, “sub”,  “div”, “mul”, “mod”  and “pow”.

Example: “java SpreadSheetPrinterV2.java 3 add 2”

This example will first add 3 and 2 together. The program will then add that amount to the bank account and print out the new total of $505.

The program also accounts for errors such as improper arguments as well as negative account balances.
